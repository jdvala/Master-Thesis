abstract = {Effective decision making is based on accurate and timely information. However, human decision makers are often overwhelmed by the huge amount of electronic data these days. The main contribution of this paper is the development of effective information agents which can autonomously classify and filter incoming electronic data on behalf of their human users. The proposed information agents are innovative because they can quickly classify electronic documents solely based on the short titles of these documents. Moreover, supervised learning is not required to train the classification models of these agents. Document classification is based on information inference conducted over a high dimensional semantic information space. What is more, a belief revision mechanism continuously maintains a set of user preferred information categories and filter documents with respect to these categories. Preliminary experimental results show that our document classification and filtering mechanism outperforms the Support Vector Machines (SVM) model which is regarded as one of the best performing classifiers.

   abstract = {In this paper we apply multilabel classification algorithms to the EUR-Lex database of legal documents of the European Union. For this document collection, we studied three different multilabel classification problems, the largest being the categorization into the EUROVOC concept hierarchy with almost 4000 classes. We evaluated three algorithms: (i) the binary relevance approach which independently trains one classifier per label; (ii) the multiclass multilabel perceptron algorithm, which respects dependencies between the base classifiers; and (iii) the multilabel pairwise perceptron algorithm, which trains one classifier for each pair of labels. All algorithms use the simple but very efficient perceptron algorithm as the underlying classifier, which makes them very suitable for large-scale multilabel classification problems. The main challenge we had to face was that the almost 8,000,000 perceptrons that had to be trained in the pairwise setting could no longer be stored in memory. We solve this problem by resorting to the dual representation of the perceptron, which makes the pairwise approach feasible for problems of this size. The results on the EUR-Lex database confirm the good predictive performance of the pairwise approach and demonstrates the feasibility of this approach for large-scale tasks.}
