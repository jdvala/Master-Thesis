\hint{Besides the title, the abstract is the most important part of your thesis, as most readers will only read title and abstract. Your goal is to advertise the rest of the thesis for potential readers. For that, you briefly explain what you are focusing on in the thesis. With a misleading abstract, you will miss interested readers and maybe even attract readers with wrong assumptions about your work which will stop reading soon. The abstract should describe the general area as well as the most interesting insights of the work. It is crucial to find the right level of abstraction and length. An abstract typically consists of one paragraph that is significantly shorter than the introduction.}

\hint{Abstracts typically follow the same structure. You start by describing the research area as well as the general and the specific problem you are focusing on. Then, you outline how you approach the problem in terms of concepts and evaluations. Finally, you close with the most interesting insights that you gained and why they are relevant for the research area.}
