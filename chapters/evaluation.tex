Evaluating a classification algorithm also known as classification model is necessary to find how competent the algorithm is on data it has never seen. The classification model generates probabilities when given the of predicting on unobserved data. 

\section{Experimental Setup}
Most of the experiments were carried out on \textit{Google Colab} is a free google service that provides Jupyter notebooks with Python environment that stores the notebooks on Google Drive. It provides a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) or TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) and has pre-installed various popular machine learning and deep learning framework. The exact detail of the system is listed in the \ref{table:HWsetup}

\end{table}

All the experiments were performed using \textit{Python 3} environment. \textit{scikit-learn}, an open source machine learning library in Python is used here for data processing and training the SVM. For Bidirectional LSTMs, \textit{Keras} an open source neural network library written in Python is used with \textit{Tensorflow} backend.

\section{Evaluation Approach}
For evaluation, initially 70\% of data is used for training the classification models and then 30\% of the data is used for evaluation. The evaluation is done on sentence
